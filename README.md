# Computational Physics Codes ‚Äì MSc/BSc Projects

This repository contains Python codes developed during my MSc/BSc Computational Physics coursework. Projects cover a range of classical and quantum problems, numerical algorithms, and simulations used in advanced undergraduate and postgraduate instruction.

## üìì Contents

- Numerical Methods (ODEs, PDEs, Integration)
- Monte Carlo Simulations & Stochastic Processes
- Classical Physics Simulations (e.g., Mechanics, Electrodynamics)
- Quantum Physics & Quantum Computing Demos
- Data Analysis, Visualization (NumPy, Matplotlib)

> _Every folder/file includes problem statements, brief documentation, and key results where applicable._

## üõ† Getting Started

To run the codes:
- Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- Recommended: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

For Jupyter Notebooks, install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

## ü§ù Academic Use

- Codes are for educational, non-commercial use.
- Feel free to fork, cite, or adapt with attribution.

## üóÇ Assignment PDFs

Each Lab folder have PDFs (e.g., `TA_1.pdf`) and they contain the original or simillar assignment problems. Match each lab code file to its corresponding problem using these documents.
